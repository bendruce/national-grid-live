# National Grid Energy Generation Dashboard Project

## Welcome to my National Grid Energy Generation Dashboard!

I was inspired by [Kate Morley's National Grid project](https://grid.iamkate.com/), which provides an elegant and real-time visualization of the UK's energy generation mix. After seeing how powerful this concept could be, I wanted to take advantage of open-source APIs myself and use this as a learning opportunity. Specifically, I decided to build my own version of the dashboard using TypeScript as a way to boost my familiarity with the language and improve my ability to work with type safety in modern JavaScript applications.

## Project Overview

This dashboard pulls real-time data from open-source APIs, such as the UK Carbon Intensity API, and provides users with a breakdown of electricity generation sources (like wind, solar, gas, and others). The goal was to create a sleek, informative interface that helps users understand where their energy comes from while improving my own skills in both TypeScript and front-end development with React.

## Features

- Real-Time Data: Fetches real-time energy generation data from open-source APIs.
- Visual Data Representation: Utilizes charts and graphs (built with Chart.js) to visualize the energy mix in an easy-to-understand format.
- Dark Mode: Includes a dark mode toggle, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout, ensuring the dashboard works well across different device sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Main Stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
- Other: Git, GitHub for version control

## Goals & Learning Objectives

Boosting TypeScript Knowledge: This project was a hands-on way for me to practice TypeScript in a real-world scenario.
Using Open APIs: I wanted to explore how to effectively integrate third-party APIs and manage live data in an efficient way.
Building Interactive UI: Creating an engaging dashboard interface that responds to real-time changes was another goal.
